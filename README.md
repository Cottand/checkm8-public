## Checkm8

This is our solution the Imperial College Computing dept. first year end of year project. We were awarded full marks and the title _Most interesting extension_ for our solution.

It consists of basic implementations of an ARM emulator and an assembler, and of its extension, an autonomous chess player powered by computer vision and SingularityNet's AI alphaZero service.

Unfortunately, because some of our solution is relevant to future students, by making it public the team risks being accused of allowing plagiarism. Because of this, only the extension is public.

 However, if you are not an Imperial Computing 1st year student, you are welcome to request access to the whole solution (which is big and therefore shows code quality better). You can do this by getting in touch with any of us.
